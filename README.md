# Stack

## What does it do?
This program demonstrates the use of a stack data structure in Java. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
In this program, the stack is used to store and manipulate Game objects. The program showcases various operations that can be performed on a stack, including:
- Pushing (adding) elements onto the stack using the push method.
- Popping (removing) elements from the stack using the pop method.
- Peeking (retrieving) the element on top of the stack without removing it using the peek method.
- Checking if the stack is empty using the isEmpty method.
- Checking if the stack contains a specific item using the contains method.
- Retrieving the size of the stack using the size method.
By running this program, you can observe how the stack behaves and see the results of these operations in action. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications that require stack-like behavior, such as undo/redo functionality, expression evaluation, or backtracking algorithms.
